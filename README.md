# BnbDashboard

A Dashboard that can be rendered on a Television located within the shared space.

# Problem

Guests need to know key information in order to make their stay the most enjoyable

# Solution

Provide guests with information on a television screen that will render a website that will host the Airbnb Dashboard

# Why

By providing guests with helpful information, they will have a more positive experience

# Alternatives

Currently such a solution can be found in a house manual and Airbnb app. Putting key information on a television adds an additional layer of information. It also will provide other information that can't be rendered through the house manual.
